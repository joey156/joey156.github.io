    "summary": "I am a dedicated and innovative researcher with a passion for advancing the frontier of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bio-inspired control in the application of robotics. I have delivered several high-impact projects that focused on augmenting deep reinforcement learning and optimal control with bio-inspired behaviour, leading to publications in several world-leading journals, including Nature Machine Intelligence, and generating international engagement within the media. The past three years, I was also involved in a diverse set of projects and teaching responsibilities, including running master’s projects, collaborative projects with international institutes, delivering tutorials and labs, running the student rocketry propulsion team, and developing research solutions for industry-funded projects.
