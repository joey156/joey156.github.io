Hi! I'm Joey, a researcher and engineer who loves all things robots and rockets. 

For too long, robots have been promised as the answer to global labour shortages and the key to freeing humans from tedious work, yet few deployments have delivered meaningful, real-world impact. With a background in deep learning, bio-inspired control, and legged robotics, I have co-founded Eden Robotics to bridge that gap by deploying robots in industry and generating tangible value today.

In my research, I focus on augmenting control frameworks with bio-inspired heuristics, new data modalities, and novel method integrations to push the boundaries of legged robot performance in both manipulation and locomotion.
